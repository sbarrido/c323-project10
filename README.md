# Gesture And Sensor Activity application

Dynamic Android Mobile application that takes advantages of the Android sensors. 

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:
 
* [x] Android API to take advantage of user gestures by reading from a sensor like accelerometer
* [x] User swiping on screen will cause object to move
* [x] Record user gestures from the top fragment and store its name in the bottom fragment
* [x] when phone is rotated, the left side fragment is the gesture playground and the right side stores the type of gesture


## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

![]().

## Notes

In this application we see the return of the activity lifecyle whenever the phone is rotated. Information must be passed between the screen rotations. Rather than using views and their lifecyle, this project aims to use Jetpack Compose instead.
